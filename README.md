The TV Guide App is designed to display channels and their timings in a grid view. It follows an object-oriented approach and utilizes an extendable architecture, including a coordinator, data source, router view, view controller, model, and presentation logic with a network layer. Additionally, a few unit tests have been implemented to showcase the power of unit testing. This architecture can be easily extended to incorporate features such as infinite scrolling and caching.

## Features

- Display channels and timings in a grid view.
- Object-oriented approach for better code organization and maintainability.
- Extendable architecture for easy addition of new features.
- Coordinator pattern for handling navigation flow.
- Data source for managing the data displayed in the grid view.
- Router view for encapsulating the logic related to navigation.
- View controller for displaying the grid view and handling user interactions.
- Model for representing the data structure of channels and timings.
- Presentation logic with a network layer for fetching data from a remote server.
- Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.
